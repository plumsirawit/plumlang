# Language Specification

## Status: WORK IN PROGRESS

## Description

The grammar is specified in `grammar.ebnf`, using [ISO/IEC 14977 EBNF (1996) metasyntax](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-14977.pdf).

The main goal of this language is to mimic a programmer's natural language. For example, one could speak this language over a voice channel and it would still be easily understandable by humans.

## Examples

See `/examples/*.plum` for references.
