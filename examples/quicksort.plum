Read an int32 N.
Read N int64s and store them in xs.

Define function quickSort which takes a copy of A of type [int64] and returns [int64]. {
  If length(A) is 1, just return A.
  Let pivot be A[0].
  Let left be quickSort A[i such that A[i] <= pivot].
  Let right be quickSort A[i such that A[i] > pivot].
  Return left ++ right.
}

Let ys be quickSort(xs).
For i from 0 to length(ys)-1, do {
  Print ys[i], followed by a space, except when i == length(ys)-1.
}
Print a line.
